        description: `A fundamental compound barbell exercise for overall leg development, primarily targeting the quadriceps (as well as glutes and hamstrings):contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. 
  Coaching Tips: Set the bar securely on your upper back, keep your chest up and core braced, push your hips back and down to descend until your thighs are at least parallel to the floor (or below), ensuring your knees track over your toes. Drive through your heels to stand back up, maintaining an upright torso and neutral spine throughout. 
  Common Errors: Shallow depth (not going low enough), allowing the knees to cave inward (valgus collapse), heels coming off the ground, or rounding the lower back due to inadequate core tightness.

  Coaching Tips: Hold the barbell just above your chest, resting on your deltoids with elbows high in front (upper arms parallel to the ground). Maintain a tall chest and engaged core as you squat down, keeping your weight mid-foot and knees tracking over toes. Drive upward by pushing through the heels, staying upright so the bar doesn't roll forward. 
  Common Errors: Dropping the elbows (which causes the bar to fall forward), rounding the upper back, or not achieving sufficient depth. Limited wrist/shoulder mobility can also cause form issues—using a cross-arm grip or straps can help if keeping elbows high is difficult.`,

Keep your torso upright and core tight as you bend the front knee, lowering until your front thigh is about parallel to the floor (back knee approaching the ground). Drive through the heel of the front foot to return to standing. Most of your weight should be on the lead leg.

Place your feet about shoulder-width apart on the platform (foot placement can be adjusted to emphasize different muscles). Unlock the safety and lower the platform under control until your knees bend about 90 degrees (or slightly more if flexibility allows), then press through your full foot to extend your legs without locking out the knees aggressively. Maintain a neutral spine against the back pad.

  Coaching Tips: Stand facing a sturdy bench or box. Place your entire foot on the platform, then press through that heel to lift your body up onto the box, bringing the trailing leg up to balance (you can either tap the trailing foot or drive the knee up). Step down under control, leading with the same trailing leg. Keep your torso upright and focus on using the lead leg (minimize pushing off the back leg). 
  Common Errors: Pushing excessively with the lower (trailing) leg instead of the working leg, not stepping high enough to challenge the muscles (using too low of a step reduces effectiveness), or allowing the knee of the working leg to cave inward.

The box squat is commonly used in strength training to encourage proper depth and to emphasize the posterior chain while still working the quads. It can help develop explosive power from a dead stop and ensure consistent squat depth. 
  Coaching Tips: Position a box or bench behind you at the desired height (often around parallel thigh position). Set up as you would for a normal squat (bar on back, core braced). Initiate the movement by pushing your hips back and descending under control until you sit back onto the box. Pause briefly (do not fully relax or rock back), then drive through your heels and contract your glutes/quads to stand back up. Keep your shins relatively vertical and maintain tension in your torso even while on the box. 
  Common Errors: Plopping down hard onto the box (losing tension and risking injury), rocking backward on the box (which can throw off your balance), or not pausing (turning it into a touch-and-go, which defeats the purpose).

Leg extensions are effective for targeting the rectus femoris and vastus muscles directly, and are often used to increase quad strength and muscle definition (or for rehab to strengthen the quads). However, they provide little functional carryover compared to compound lifts, so they are best used as accessory movements for hypertrophy. 
  Coaching Tips: Sit in the leg extension machine and adjust the pad so it rests just above your ankles. Align your knee joint with the machine's axis of rotation. Grip the side handles, keep your back against the seat, and slowly extend your legs by contracting your quads until your knees are nearly straight (do not forcefully lock out). Squeeze at the top for a moment, then lower the weight back down under control to the starting position (about a 90-degree knee bend or slightly more). 
  Common Errors: Using excessive momentum or swinging the weight up (should be a controlled movement), not using full range of motion (only partially straightening the leg), or letting the hips lift off the seat.

        description: `A foundational barbell lift and one of the powerlifting “big 3,” the conventional deadlift develops total posterior chain strength, with heavy emphasis on the hamstrings, glutes, and spinal erectors. It involves lifting a weight from the floor by extending the hips and knees, and is highly effective for building raw strength and power in the lower body and back. 
  Coaching Tips: Stand with your feet roughly hip-width apart with the barbell over mid-foot (about an inch from your shins). Bend at the hips and knees to grip the bar just outside your knees. Keep your back flat (neutral spine) and chest up, pull your shoulder blades down and back (engage lats). Drive through your heels to lift the bar off the floor, extending your knees and hips. Keep the barbell close to your body as you rise. Finish by locking out your hips at the top, squeezing your glutes. Reverse the motion by hinging at the hips and controlling the bar back to the floor. 
  Common Errors: Rounding the lower back or shoulders during the pull (increasing injury risk), letting the bar drift away from the body (which strains the back), jerking the bar off the floor (instead of a smooth push from the legs), or hyperextending (leaning back) at lockout. Also, not engaging the legs enough and lifting primarily with the back is a common mistake—ensure you push the floor away with your legs at the start.`,

The RDL is done with a barbell or dumbbells starting from a standing position (unlike a deadlift from the floor) and focuses on strengthening the hamstrings through hip extension without heavy knee involvement. It's excellent for developing hamstring flexibility and lower-back control under load. 
  Coaching Tips: Start standing with the barbell in front of your thighs (or holding dumbbells at your sides). Keep a soft bend in your knees, then hinge at the hips by pushing your butt back while maintaining a flat back. Lower the weight along your legs until you feel a strong stretch in your hamstrings (typically when the bar reaches mid-shin or just below the knees, depending on flexibility). Your spine should remain neutral and your shins near-vertical. Engage your hamstrings and glutes to drive your hips forward and rise back to standing. Keep the weight close to your body throughout. 
  Common Errors: Rounding the back or shoulders (shoulders should stay retracted), squatting down instead of hinging (too much knee bend turns it into a partial squat), or going so low that you lose your lumbar curve. Another mistake is thrusting the hips forward excessively at the top—stand up straight but don't lean back.

In a good morning, the movement is similar to an RDL but with the bar positioned on the back like a squat. It's an advanced exercise that can greatly strengthen the posterior chain, but it requires strict form to be performed safely. 
  Coaching Tips: Stand with a barbell on your upper back (as in a back squat), feet about hip-width apart. Keep a slight bend in your knees. While keeping your back flat and core braced, hinge at the hips by pushing your hips straight back. Lower your torso forward until it's roughly parallel to the ground (or until you feel your hamstrings stretch significantly), maintaining a neutral spine and keeping your weight on your heels/mid-foot. Then contract your hamstrings and glutes to reverse the motion, driving your hips forward and lifting your torso back to upright. Eyes should look forward or slightly down (to keep neck aligned). 
  Common Errors: Rounding the back at the bottom (losing the neutral spine), bending the knees too much (turning it into a quasi-squat), or going too low for your flexibility (which can cause form break). Additionally, using too much weight is a common error with good mornings—start light to master the hip hinge, as this exercise can strain the lower back if done improperly or too heavy.`,

The GHR is highly regarded in strength & conditioning for building strong hamstrings and is often used by sprinters, powerlifters, and athletes to improve posterior chain strength. It closely mimics the hamstrings' function of bending the knee and extending the hip. 
  Coaching Tips: Secure your feet under the foot pads of a GHR machine with your knees on the pad (adjust so your knees are just behind the pad’s edge). Start from the top: your body upright, hips extended. Begin by lowering your torso forward by extending at the knees — keep your back and hips extended (straight line from head to knee) as you lower under control. Once you are near horizontal (or when you can no longer hold without free-falling), pull your body back up by contracting your hamstrings (and assist by pushing your toes into the foot plate if needed). You can also initiate a bit of a hip hinge at the bottom and then extend the hips as you curl to scale the difficulty. 
  Common Errors: Arching or sagging at the hips (you should avoid bending at the waist; the movement should mostly occur at the knee joint), using excessive momentum or jerking to rise, and not using a full range of motion. This is a challenging exercise; common mistakes include pushing the hips back to make it easier (turning it into more of a back extension) or not controlling the descent (just dropping down).

It is extremely effective for developing hamstring strength and has been shown to significantly reduce hamstring injury rates in athletes:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. 
  Coaching Tips: Kneel on a padded surface with someone or something securing your ankles (your feet can be anchored under a padded bar or heavy equipment if a partner isn’t available). Keep your body straight from your knees to your head (avoid bending at the hips). Slowly lean forward, resisting the fall as much as possible with your hamstrings. Go as far as you can under control; you may catch yourself with your hands on the ground when you can no longer resist, then push off lightly to help curl yourself back up to the start (if you cannot pull yourself up unassisted). Focus on the hamstring contraction to control the lowering. 
  Common Errors: Bending at the hips (which reduces hamstring involvement) – you want to maintain a straight line from head to knee. Another error is dropping too quickly without resistance; fight against gravity as long as possible to get the eccentric benefit. Additionally, flaring the hips or not keeping ankles, knees, and shoulders in alignment can reduce effectiveness. This is a very challenging move, so use assistance as needed to maintain good form.`,

There are two common machine variants: lying leg curls and seated leg curls, both of which effectively work the hamstring muscles (primarily the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus). Machine leg curls allow you to isolate knee flexion, which complements hip-extension exercises like deadlifts to train the hamstrings more completely. 
  Coaching Tips: **Lying Leg Curl:** Lie face down on the machine, position the pad just above your heels (Achilles area), and grasp the handles. Keep your hips down and core engaged. Curl your legs by contracting your hamstrings, bringing your heels toward your butt as far as comfortable. Pause briefly at the top, then slowly return the weight until your legs are extended again. **Seated Leg Curl:** Sit with your back against the pad, line up your knees with the machine pivot, and place the lower leg behind the roller pad. Grip the handles and curl down, bringing your feet back under the seat, then control the weight back up. 
  Common Errors: Lifting the hips off the pad during lying curls (which can reduce hamstring isolation and strain the lower back) – avoid this by engaging your core and not using excessive weight. Using momentum or swinging the weight is another error; the movement should be smooth and controlled. Additionally, not completing the full range (not curling fully or not extending fully) will reduce effectiveness. Adjust the machine to fit your leg length to ensure proper form.`,

By working one leg at a time, it helps address asymmetries and improve hip stability. This exercise also engages the smaller stabilizer muscles of the ankle and hip, and challenges your balance and coordination in addition to strengthening the posterior chain. 
  Coaching Tips: Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in one hand (same side as the working leg or opposite side, depending on balance preference). Stand on one leg with a slight knee bend. Hinge at the hip of the standing leg by extending your free leg straight behind you as your torso leans forward. Keep your back flat and hips level (avoid rotating your hips open) as you lower the weight toward the ground. Go down until you feel a strong stretch in the hamstring or your torso is nearly parallel to floor, then squeeze your hamstring and glute to return to standing, bringing the extended leg forward. You can lightly tap the moving foot down between reps for balance if needed. 
  Common Errors: Losing balance or twisting the torso – focus on keeping your core tight and hips squared to the floor. A common mistake is allowing the lower back to round; maintain a neutral spine. Also, some people bend the knee too much (which lessens hamstring load) or conversely lock the knee out (which can strain it); keep a slight knee bend throughout.

The stiff-leg deadlift (SLDL) is similar to a Romanian deadlift, but typically starts from the floor and keeps the knees almost straight (never locked, but less bend than an RDL). This increases the demand on the hamstrings and lower back, making it a potent posterior chain exercise. 
  Coaching Tips: Begin with the barbell on the floor close to your shins, feet hip-width apart. Bend over by hinging at the hips and only a slight bend at the knees—your hips will be higher than in a conventional deadlift. Grasp the bar with a shoulder-width grip. Set your back flat and take the slack out of the bar. Lift by driving your hips forward and pulling your shoulders back, keeping your knees almost straight. As the bar passes your knees, squeeze your glutes to stand tall. Then lower the bar by pushing your hips back, keeping your legs relatively straight, and controlling the bar down to the floor (you should feel a stretch in your hamstrings on the way down). 
  Common Errors: Rounding the back (since the position is bent over, it’s easy to lose spinal neutrality—keep core braced and back flat). Another error is fully locking out the knees; a slight bend is needed to protect the joints and keep tension on the hamstrings. Don’t bounce the weight off the floor between reps, and avoid using excessive weight until you have the flexibility and strength to maintain form, as the SLDL can put stress on the lower back if done improperly.`,

Often called "back extensions" or "hyperextensions," this movement is an excellent accessory for strengthening the lower back in conjunction with the hamstrings, improving overall posterior chain endurance and stability. 
  Coaching Tips: Adjust the hyperextension bench so that the top of the pad is just below your hip crease, allowing you to bend at the hips freely. Secure your feet under the foot pads. Start with your body in a straight line, crossed arms or hands lightly behind your head. From the top position, lower your torso by bending at the hips, keeping your back flat, until your upper body is roughly perpendicular to the floor (or as far as comfortable). Then squeeze your glutes and hamstrings to raise your torso back up until it's in line with your legs (no need to arch beyond a straight line). If using weight, hold a plate or dumbbell against your chest. 
  Common Errors: Hyperextending (arching) the back at the top excessively – you only need to come up to neutral spine alignment, not arch backwards. Another error is rounding the back on the way down; keep your back neutral throughout by engaging your core. Avoid swinging or using momentum; the movement should be controlled.

This exercise was popularized in powerlifting circles as a way to strengthen the posterior chain and rehabilitate the lower back with minimal spinal compression. It can help improve glute/hamstring strength and provide traction to the lumbar spine. 
  Coaching Tips: Lie face down on a reverse hyper machine or a high bench with your hips at the edge and legs hanging down. Secure your torso by holding onto the handles or edges of the bench. Start with your legs relaxed downward. Keeping your legs relatively straight (slight knee bend), contract your glutes and hamstrings to raise your legs up behind you until they are roughly parallel to the floor (in line with your body). Control the swing as you lower your legs back down past the vertical. On a reverse hyper machine, you might have your feet hooked to a strap with weight plates, providing resistance. Focus on using your glutes to lift rather than momentum. 
  Common Errors: Swinging the legs excessively and relying on momentum instead of muscle contraction. You should avoid an uncontrolled pendulum motion—ensure a brief pause at the top to eliminate momentum. Also, hyperextending the lower back at the top is a mistake; raise the legs only to body level.

It also engages the hamstrings and helps improve hip extension power, which carries over to sprinting and jumping performance. 
  Coaching Tips: Sit on the ground with your upper back against a bench (bench edge around your shoulder blades). Roll a padded barbell over your hips. Bend your knees about 90 degrees with feet flat on the floor, shoulder-width apart. Keeping your chin tucked and core braced, drive through your heels to thrust your hips upward. Lift until your thighs are roughly parallel to the floor and your torso forms a straight line from shoulders to knees, squeezing your glutes at the top. Lower the hips back down under control. Keep your knees out (in line with toes) and avoid arching the lower back; motion should come from hip extension. 
  Common Errors: Hyperextending the lower back at the top (leaning back instead of focusing on glutes) – to avoid this, tuck your chin and ribcage down. Another error is placing feet too far forward or too far back, which can shift emphasis to hamstrings or quads (find a foot position where you feel the glutes working most at the top). Lastly, not using full range (e.g., doing only partial short pumps) or bouncing off the ground without control reduces effectiveness.

  Common Errors: Hyperextending the lower back (arching too high) instead of using the glutes — avoid by not going beyond a straight line body position. Also, placing feet too far from your hips (which turns it into more hamstring exercise) or too close (which can limit range of motion or cause cramping) can be errors; adjust foot position for a comfortable movement where glutes do the work. Another mistake is letting the knees flare out or collapse in; keep knees in line with hips and feet. Lastly, not engaging the core can lead to an anterior pelvic tilt at the top, so maintain abdominal tension throughout.`,

        description: `A deadlift variation with a wide stance and hands gripping the bar inside the knees, placing more emphasis on the glutes, adductors, and quads relative to the conventional deadlift (while still working the hamstrings and back). The sumo stance reduces the range of motion and can be easier on the lower back due to a more upright torso angle. It’s a favored style for some powerlifters and lifters with strong hip musculature or limited mobility in a conventional stance. 
  Coaching Tips: Stand with a wide stance, feet pointed out at ~30° and positioned so that when you bend your knees, they track over your ankles. Position your shins close to the bar. Grip the bar with hands shoulder-width apart (inside your legs). Drop your hips and lift your chest, keeping your back flat. Push your knees out (don’t let them cave) and drive your feet through the floor to initiate the lift. As the bar rises, keep it close to your body; your hips and shoulders should rise together. Lock out by thrusting the hips forward and squeezing the glutes at the top. 
  Common Errors: Letting the hips shoot up too fast (losing the leg drive and turning it into a stiff-legged pull), knees caving inward, or not keeping the shins vertical enough (which can drag the bar forward). Another mistake is setting up with the toes too forward and knees not tracking properly, which can strain the knees. Ensure you engage your lats to keep the bar path vertical and avoid the bar drifting away from you. Also, as with any deadlift, avoid rounding your lower back—maintain a neutral spine throughout.`,

The kettlebell swing trains the posterior chain to generate force quickly (hip extension power) and has excellent athletic carryover for activities like jumping and sprinting. It primarily targets the glutes and hamstrings, while also engaging the core and back muscles to stabilize the spine. 
  Coaching Tips: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and a kettlebell a foot or two in front of you on the ground. Hinge at the hips (like an RDL) to pick up the kettlebell and hike it back between your legs (your knees bend slightly, and you push your hips back; your chest comes forward but back stays flat). From this loaded position, forcefully snap your hips forward, driving through your glutes, to swing the kettlebell up to about chest level. Let the kettlebell swing back down under control by hinging at the hips again, loading the hamstrings for the next rep. Arms stay straight but act like ropes; power comes from the hip thrust, not the shoulders. 
  Common Errors: Squatting the swing (bending knees too much) instead of hinging – the motion should be a hip hinge, not a deep knee bend. Also, using the shoulders to lift the kettlebell rather than letting the momentum from the hip drive raise it (the arms shouldn’t be doing the primary work). Avoid rounding your back; keep your spine neutral and core braced at the bottom of the swing. Additionally, do not swing the kettlebell too high (shoulder height is sufficient; this is not a front raise). Timing and rhythm are important, so start light to master the form.`,

        description: `A cable exercise that targets the glutes and hamstrings by mimicking the hip hinge motion, somewhat like a horizontal version of a kettlebell swing or RDL. The pull-through uses a cable machine (or band) attached low, which provides constant tension on the glutes throughout the range of motion. It’s a great accessory to isolate hip extension and teach proper glute engagement, with minimal load on the spine. 
  Coaching Tips: Attach a rope handle to a low pulley. Stand facing away from the machine, feet shoulder-width apart, and straddle the rope between your legs (reach through and grab the rope with both hands). Step forward a couple feet so there’s tension on the cable. From a standing position, hinge at your hips (soft knees) and allow your hands to be pulled through your legs by the cable. Keep your back flat and chest up as you bend over until your torso is almost parallel to the floor or you feel a stretch in the hamstrings. Then forcefully contract your glutes and drive your hips forward to stand up straight, pulling the rope through to the front. Squeeze the glutes at the top without leaning back. 
  Common Errors: Standing too close so there’s no tension at the start or not hinging enough (turning it into a shallow movement). Also, avoid rounding your lower back – maintain a neutral spine. Don’t pull with your arms; your arms should just hold the rope, and the glutes/hamstrings do the work to thrust the hips. Another mistake is flaring the knees outward excessively or caving them in; keep knees tracking neutral over feet. Control the return phase so the weight stack doesn’t crash down between reps.`,

Reverse lunges are slightly easier on the knees due to a less abrupt deceleration, and they help build strong hips and thighs with improved balance. Like other lunges, they work quads, glutes, and hamstrings, but the mechanics of stepping back encourage the front leg to use more hip drive (glutes) to return. 
  Coaching Tips: Start standing upright with feet together. Take a big step backward with one leg. Land on the ball of your back foot and lower your body by bending your front knee and dropping your back knee toward the floor. Your front shin should be roughly vertical and front thigh about parallel to the ground at the bottom. Push through the heel of your front foot to come back up, bringing the rear leg forward to the start position. Keep your torso upright and core engaged throughout. Either alternate legs or repeat all reps on one side then switch. 
  Common Errors: Taking too small of a step back (which can push the front knee too far forward and limit glute engagement) or stepping too far back (causing an excessive arch or instability). Also, leaning the torso forward excessively or letting the front knee cave inward. Much like the forward lunge, control is key: avoid slamming the back knee down. Ensure your front heel stays down and do not push off your back foot too much – the front leg should do most of the work.`,

Often done on a dedicated kickback machine or with a cable pulley attached to the ankle, this exercise really focuses on squeezing the glutes one side at a time. It's commonly used in bodybuilding routines to target and shape the glutes, and in rehab settings to engage glutes without loading the spine. 
  Coaching Tips: If using a **cable machine**, attach an ankle cuff to the low pulley and secure it around your ankle. Stand facing the weight stack, hold the machine for support, and start with your cuffed leg slightly back. Keeping a slight bend in the working knee, extend your leg straight back behind you by contracting your glute. Go until your hip is extended (leg just behind the line of your body) while maintaining an upright torso. Control the leg as you return to the start position. If using a **glute kickback machine**, position yourself per the machine's instructions (usually torso leaning forward onto a pad) and push back against the footpad with your heel. 
  Common Errors: Arching the lower back to lift the leg higher – the movement should come from the hip/glute, not from lumbar extension. Keep your core tight to prevent this. Another mistake is using momentum (swinging the leg) rather than a controlled squeeze. Also, not completing the range of motion (just doing small pulses) will reduce effectiveness; ensure you get a good contraction by bringing the leg fully into extension. Lastly, turning the foot outward excessively to compensate can engage other muscles; keep your toes pointing straight (or slightly inward) to focus on the glute.`,

Hip abduction exercises strengthen the lateral hip muscles important for hip stability, knee tracking, and athletic movements that require lateral control. Typically done on a seated hip abduction machine or with a resistance band around the knees, this exercise isolates the outer glutes which contribute to a well-rounded hip strength and can improve squat and deadlift stability. 
  Coaching Tips: **Machine Abduction:** Sit in the abductor machine with the outer pads against your knees/thighs. Keep your back against the backrest and hold any provided handles. Start with legs together (pads touching) under tension. Using your glute muscles, push your knees apart, spreading your legs as far as comfortable. Pause briefly at the widest position, then slowly allow your legs to come back together under control. **Band Abduction (Lateral Walk or Clamshell):** Place a loop band around your thighs just above the knees (for clamshells, lie on your side with knees bent and open/close your top knee like a clamshell; for lateral walks, slightly squat and step sideways maintaining band tension). 
  Common Errors: Using momentum or bouncing at the end of range on the machine (ensure a controlled movement and squeeze). Only doing partial range reps; try to abduct as far as strength/mobility allows for full contraction. For band work, common mistakes are letting knees cave in under band tension or, in lateral walks, stepping too narrow such that band tension slackens. Always keep some tension and focus on the side-hip muscle doing the work, not just flinging the legs outward.`,

The lateral lunge adds a frontal-plane movement that is often neglected, helping develop lateral hip strength and flexibility. It's beneficial for athletes since many sports involve side-to-side movements, and it challenges balance and mobility differently than sagittal plane exercises. 
  Coaching Tips: Stand with feet together. Take a big step directly out to the side with one leg. As your foot plants, push your hips back and bend the stepping knee, keeping the trailing leg straight. Descend until the stepping thigh is near parallel (or as far as your mobility allows) while the other leg stays straight, foot flat. Keep your chest up and core engaged. Then push through the heel of the bent leg to return to the starting position, bringing your foot back in. You can alternate sides or do all reps on one side. If adding weight, you can hold a dumbbell or kettlebell at your chest (goblet style) or two dumbbells hanging. 
  Common Errors: Rounding the back or leaning excessively forward instead of sitting the hips back. Letting the knee of the stepping leg cave inward – actively push it out, in line with toes. Not stepping wide enough or, conversely, stepping too wide (leading to an awkward position); find a stride that allows a deep lunge while keeping the flat foot on the floor. Also avoid keeping all the weight on the moving leg’s toes – ensure you load the heel to engage the glutes. Control the movement; don’t just collapse into the side lunge without muscle tension.`,

This modification changes the mechanics: typically allowing a more upright torso and more knee bend than a conventional deadlift, which shifts some emphasis to the quads while still heavily recruiting glutes and hamstrings. Many find trap bar deadlifts more accessible and lower-back-friendly. It's an excellent compound movement for overall leg and hip strength, bridging the gap between a squat and a deadlift. 
  Coaching Tips: Stand in the center of the trap bar with feet hip-width apart. Bend at the hips and knees to grip the handles (most trap bars have high handles; use those if mobility is an issue, or low handles for more range). Keep your chest up, shoulder blades back, and core tight. Drive through your legs to lift the weight, extending your hips and knees simultaneously. The movement feels like a squat/deadlift hybrid – your hips will start a bit lower and your knees more bent than a conventional deadlift. At the top, stand fully upright, then lower the bar by sitting back and bending your knees, maintaining a flat back, until the weights touch the floor. 
  Common Errors: Treating it exactly like a squat (hips dropping too low) or exactly like a deadlift (hips too high) – find a balance where you feel both quads and glutes engage. Rounding the back is still a risk if form is poor; maintain neutral spine. Also avoid pushing your hips up faster than your shoulders (which would disengage the legs). Don’t let your knees collapse inward during the drive. Control the descent rather than crashing the weight down. A smooth lift with the trap bar should allow your center of gravity to stay between your feet, so also ensure you’re not rocking forward onto your toes or too far back.`,

The pull-up is a gold-standard back exercise – EMG data shows that wide-grip pull-ups activate the lats and mid-back more than many machine exercises:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}. It also engages the biceps and forearms as assisting muscles. Mastering pull-ups builds significant upper-body pulling strength and back width. 
  Coaching Tips: Grasp the pull-up bar with a wide overhand grip (palms facing away, hands a few inches wider than shoulder width). Start from a dead hang with arms fully extended. Initiate the pull by drawing your shoulder blades down and back (depress and retract scapulae), then drive your elbows down to bring your chin up over the bar. Focus on leading with your chest to the bar and squeezing your lats. Lower yourself in a controlled manner all the way down until arms are straight. Avoid using momentum (no kipping, if doing strict pull-ups). If you cannot do a full pull-up yet, use resistance bands or an assisted pull-up machine for help. 
  Common Errors: Not using full range of motion (e.g., not fully extending at the bottom or not getting chin to/over the bar at the top). Flaring the elbows out excessively (which can internally rotate the shoulders) – try to keep elbows closer to the frontal plane. Swinging or kipping unintentionally, which reduces muscle engagement and can be unsafe if not intended. Additionally, many people crane their neck to reach the bar; instead, aim to bring the chest toward the bar and keep neck neutral. Grip width that is too wide can shorten range of motion and strain shoulders; a few inches wider than shoulders is usually optimal.`,

The bent-over row builds thickness in the back and complements the pull-up for complete back development. It mimics a pulling motion akin to picking something up and pulling it to your torso. This compound movement allows the use of relatively heavy weights to stimulate back strength and hypertrophy. 
  Coaching Tips: Stand with feet hip-width apart, and grasp a barbell with an overhand or underhand grip (overhand hits upper back and lats; underhand can emphasize lats and biceps a bit more). Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back flat, until your torso is roughly at a 45° angle (or closer to parallel for a Pendlay row variation). Let the bar hang at arm’s length. Begin the row by driving your elbows back and pulling the bar toward your lower ribcage or upper abdomen. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement. Lower the bar under control back to the start, letting your arms straighten fully. Maintain a tight core and neutral spine throughout; your back should not round. 
  Common Errors: Rounding the back or hunching shoulders forward (avoid by keeping scapula retracted and core tight). Using excessive momentum by jerking the torso up (“yanking” the bar) – a little body English is sometimes used with heavy rows, but intentionally; ensure most of the movement is from your arms/back. Also, pulling the bar too high (toward chest/neck) flares elbows and shifts focus to upper traps and rear delts; generally aim for lower chest/upper abs where lats engage most.

They significantly work the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, trapezius, and biceps. By stabilizing yourself with the other arm on a bench, you can isolate the working side’s back muscles and get a strong contraction. 
  Coaching Tips: Place one knee and the same-side hand on a flat bench (for example, right knee and right hand on the bench) so that your back is roughly parallel to the floor. Your other foot is on the ground for stability, and your free arm (left arm, in this case) hangs straight down holding a dumbbell, shoulder relaxed. Keep your back flat and core engaged. Initiate the row by driving your left elbow up and back, pulling the dumbbell towards your hip or lower ribcage. Focus on squeezing the back muscles (imagine elbow towards spine). Lower the dumbbell under control until your arm is fully extended again. Complete all reps on one side, then switch. Keep your neck in line with your spine (look at the bench, not up or hanging down excessively). 
  Common Errors: Rotating the torso and turning the movement into a twist – your shoulders should stay square to the bench; only the arm moves. Using momentum (jerking or heaving the dumbbell up) instead of muscle contraction. Also, shrugging the shoulder toward your ear as you row (engaging traps too much) – instead, think of drawing the shoulder blade back and down.

T-bar rows heavily work the lats, rhomboids, middle traps, and rear delts, and because of the chest-supported variations, can minimize lower back strain. This exercise often allows you to lift heavy with good form, making it great for back thickness and strength. 
  Coaching Tips: If using a T-bar row machine, position your chest against the pad and feet on the platform. Grasp the handles (neutral or pronated grip depending on the machine). From arms extended, pull the weight toward your chest by driving your elbows back, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the end of the movement.

Row the barbell’s end to your chest or upper abdomen, then lower slowly. 
  Common Errors: For chest-supported machines, a common mistake is shrugging or using the biceps too much instead of retracting the scapula; focus on pinching shoulder blades. If not chest-supported, one might cheat by raising the torso up (using momentum); try to keep your torso angle consistent to isolate the back. In the landmine setup, ensure you stay balanced and don’t let the bar drift to one side. Also avoid jerking the weight—use a controlled pull and release.

A wide-grip pulldown emphasizes the upper lats and teres major (giving that "V-taper" look), while close-grip or neutral-grip variations can target lower lats or different angles. Pulldowns allow for controlled negatives and continuous tension on the lats. 
  Coaching Tips: Sit at the lat pulldown station and adjust the thigh pad to snugly hold you down. Grasp the bar slightly wider than shoulder width with an overhand grip (or use the attachment of choice). Start with arms fully extended overhead (you should feel a stretch in your lats). Initiate by pulling your shoulder blades down ("depress" the scapulae) and then drive your elbows down and back to pull the bar to the upper chest/clavicle area. Think of pulling with your elbows, not your hands, to better engage the lats. Keep a slight lean back (around 30°) but do not swing excessively. Squeeze your back at the bottom position, then slowly release the bar back up to the starting position, fully extending the arms and re-stretching the lats. 
  Common Errors: Pulling the bar down behind the neck – this is not recommended for shoulder health (stick to front-of-neck pulldowns). Using too much momentum, such as leaning way back and turning it into a row, takes tension off the lats. Avoid half-repping (not bringing the bar down far enough or not controlling up to full arm extension). Also, avoid shrugging your shoulders up as you pull; keep shoulders down to maximize lat engagement.

It's a great exercise for building upper-back strength and endurance, and for beginners, it helps develop pulling strength on the path to achieving pull-ups. 
  Coaching Tips: Set a bar at about waist height (or use suspension straps/rings). Lie underneath the bar and grab it with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder width. Your body should be straight, heels on the ground, arms extended (so you’re hanging under the bar). Keep your core tight and body in a rigid line (like a plank).

Strong traps also contribute to upper back stability. This exercise can be done with a barbell, dumbbells, or machine, but the barbell allows for very heavy loads to really stress the traps. 
  Coaching Tips: Stand holding a barbell with an overhand grip, hands about shoulder-width apart (or slightly wider), arms extended straight down in front of you. Keep your feet about hip-width apart, knees soft (not locked). Without bending your elbows, lift (shrug) your shoulders straight up toward your ears as high as possible. Imagine trying to touch your ears with your shoulders. Pause briefly at the top to squeeze the traps, then lower the shoulders back down to a full stretch. Keep your head neutral (looking forward) and do not roll your shoulders (the movement should be straight up and down). 
  Common Errors: Rolling the shoulders in a circular motion – this is not useful and can strain the shoulder joints; the effective part of the exercise is the vertical up-and-down motion. Using the biceps or bending elbows to hitch the weight up (this shifts focus away from traps). Also, using momentum by jerking or bouncing the weight; it’s better to use a slightly lighter weight that you can strictly shrug.

It's considered a derivative of the full clean (which catches in a deep squat). According to strength coaches, the power clean is excellent for training the “violent” hip extension needed for athletic explosiveness:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. 
  Coaching Tips: Start like a deadlift: feet hip-width, bar over mid-foot, hands just outside shoulder width. Drop hips so back is flat and chest up, eyes forward. Explosively extend your hips and knees to lift the bar, keeping it close to your body. Once the bar passes knees, aggressively shrug your shoulders and pull yourself under the bar, rotating your elbows forward. Catch the bar on your front shoulders with knees bent (a quarter squat), elbows high (front rack position), and stand up to finish. Key cues: keep arms straight until the shrug (don’t arm-pull early), jump with the legs to drive the bar up, and quickly get under the bar. 
  Common Errors: Pulling with the arms too early (the arms should only bend after the lower body has extended and shrugged, to quickly drop under the bar). Not reaching full extension – ensure you extend ankles, knees, hips (“triple extension”) for maximal power before the catch. Allowing the bar to swing out away from the body; it should travel close to your torso. Also, not getting the elbows around fast enough, resulting in a poor catch or banging the bar on the chest. Improper catch position (like elbows down, bar in hands not on shoulders) can strain wrists/arms. This is a technical lift, so start light, and consider professional coaching to refine form.

        description: `The classic barbell press for chest development, and one of the three powerlifting competition lifts. The bench press primarily works the pectoralis major, anterior deltoids, and triceps. It’s a proven mass and strength builder for the upper body – EMG studies show it elicits extremely high activation in the chest muscles:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} compared to flyes or push-ups. It allows heavy loads and progressive overload, making it fundamental for upper body strength. 
  Coaching Tips: Lie on a flat bench with eyes under the racked bar. Grip the barbell with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width (so forearms are vertical at the bottom). Pinch your shoulder blades together and keep them retracted to create a stable base and protect your shoulders. Unrack the bar and hold it above your chest with arms locked. Inhale and lower the bar under control to mid-chest (around the nipple line), keeping elbows at roughly a 45-degree angle from your body (not flared straight out). Touch your chest lightly (or hover just above if not comfortable touching) and then press the bar back up by driving through the chest and triceps, exhaling as you push. Lock out arms without losing shoulder blade retraction. Keep your feet flat on the floor, and maintain a slight arch in your lower back (natural arch) with butt and upper back on the bench. 
  Common Errors: Flaring elbows out to 90° which can stress the shoulders – keep them tucked a bit. Bouncing the bar off the chest (use muscle, not momentum). Lifting the butt off the bench or feet off the floor, which reduces stability and leg drive. Not using full range of motion (stopping far above the chest) unless for a specific partial-rep purpose – generally, a full range ensures maximal muscle recruitment. Also, avoid shrugging shoulders forward at the top; keep them pinned back. Wrists should be straight (stacked over elbows), not overly bent back which could cause strain.`,

        name: "Incline Barbell Bench Press",
        description: `A barbell press variation on an inclined bench (typically set at 30° to 45° incline), targeting the upper portion of the pectoral muscles (clavicular head) along with the anterior shoulders and triceps. The incline bench press shifts emphasis to the upper chest, which can improve overall chest symmetry and strength for presses. It usually requires slightly lighter weight than flat bench due to increased shoulder involvement and a longer range of motion for the clavicular pec fibers. 
  Coaching Tips: Lie on an incline bench (securely set) and position yourself similar to the flat bench setup: eyes under bar, shoulder blades retracted and down. Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder width. Unrack and stabilize the bar above your upper chest/shoulders. Lower the bar to the upper chest/just below the collarbone. Keep elbows in an intermediate angle (not overly flared). Press the bar up to arm's length, focusing on contracting the upper chest. Maintain your head, upper back, and butt on the bench (butt may be slightly off if bench is short, just ensure a stable position). Feet can be flat on ground or on the bench foot rests if available, to aid stability. 
  Common Errors: Setting the incline too high (turns it into more of a shoulder press and can strain shoulders) – usually 30° is sufficient to hit upper chest without excessive shoulder stress. Flaring elbows out high can be especially problematic on incline, so keep a moderate elbow angle. Lifting the shoulders off the bench as you press (maintain that retracted position). Also watch for the bar path – don't press vertical over the neck (which could cause you to lose control backward); the bar should travel in a slight arc staying over the upper chest region. Avoid bouncing the bar off the chest at the bottom, which can be dangerous near the collarbone; use controlled motion.`,

        name: "Dumbbell Bench Press",
        description: `A dumbbell variation of the bench press that allows a greater range of motion and independent movement of each arm, which can help address imbalances and increase chest muscle stretch at the bottom. It works the pectorals, anterior delts, and triceps similarly to barbell bench, but often recruits more stabilizer muscles since each arm is free. Dumbbells also allow a neutral or slight angle in the wrist which can be more shoulder-friendly for some lifters. 
  Coaching Tips: Sit on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on your thighs. Lie back on the bench, bringing the dumbbells to shoulder level with elbows bent (use your thighs to help kick them up if needed). Position dumbbells with palms facing forward or rotated slightly inwards (whatever is comfortable). Your upper arms should be around 45° to your body (not straight out to the side). Press the dumbbells up toward the ceiling by extending your arms, bringing the weights together above your chest. You don't have to make them touch, but they should move in a symmetrical arc. Lower the dumbbells under control, getting a good stretch in the chest at the bottom (elbows drop just below bench level if mobility allows), until the dumbbells are roughly at chest level outside your shoulders. Keep your shoulder blades retracted on the bench and feet planted for stability. 
  Common Errors: Allowing the dumbbells to track too far outward (excessive elbow flare) or letting them wobble – maintain control by moving in a smooth plane. Touching the dumbbells at the top forcefully (clanging) which can destabilize your position – a gentle touch or small gap is fine. Not going low enough to engage a full stretch (one advantage of DBs is more range than barbell, so utilize it safely). Also, be careful when bringing the weights down to start or finish; a common mistake is straining shoulders during the setup or drop – it's safer to have someone hand you the weights or to drop them to the floor safely if heavy (after the set, lower to chest and then dump to sides).`,

        description: `An incline press performed with dumbbells, targeting the upper chest and front shoulders, similar to the incline barbell press but with the benefits of dumbbells (greater range of motion and independent arm work). It helps in developing the upper pectoral muscles and often provides a more comfortable shoulder angle for some lifters. Using dumbbells on incline can also recruit stabilizers and allow slight adjustments in arm path to better engage the chest. 
  Coaching Tips: Adjust an incline bench to about 30° (up to 45°) and sit with a dumbbell on each thigh. Kick up and lie back, bringing the dumbbells to shoulder height. Start with palms facing forward (or slightly angled) and dumbbells held above the upper chest/shoulder line. Press the weights up and slightly towards each other (they don't have to touch) by extending your arms. Focus on driving with your chest muscles. Lower the dumbbells slowly to the starting position, feeling the stretch in your upper chest as your elbows come down to about shoulder level or a bit below. Keep elbows at an intermediate angle (not completely flared out, not tucked in like a close press). Maintain shoulder blades pulled back into the bench for stability and to keep tension on the chest. 
  Common Errors: Using too steep of an incline turning it into more of a shoulder press – which can strain shoulders. Flaring elbows excessively wide can put undue stress on shoulder joints. Also, allowing the dumbbells to travel too far down past comfort which could over-stretch the shoulder; go to a comfortable depth with a stretch in chest but no shoulder pain. Another mistake is banging dumbbells together at the top (unnecessary and could throw off balance). As with flat DB press, be mindful of control especially when fatigued, and use a safe method to get the dumbbells into position and to exit the exercise to avoid shoulder tweaks (e.g., at end, you can carefully lower them down to shoulders and then hips, or drop them safely if very heavy).`,

        name: "Dip (Chest Emphasis)",
        description: `Parallel bar dips leaning forward to target the chest (pectorals) strongly, while also working the triceps and front shoulders. Dips are a compound bodyweight exercise that, with a forward torso lean and flared elbows, stretch and activate the lower chest in particular. They are highly effective — EMG data shows that properly executed dips can activate the pecs comparably to the bench press and heavily stimulate the triceps as well:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}. For chest focus, technique is adjusted slightly from a strict triceps dip. 
  Coaching Tips: Grasp parallel dip bars and start with arms extended, supporting your body. To emphasize chest, tilt your torso forward (~30° lean) and let your legs drift back a bit. Flare your elbows out to the sides roughly 45-60° as you bend your arms. Lower yourself by bending elbows and shoulders until your upper arms are about parallel to the ground (going too deep past this can strain the shoulders). You should feel a stretch in your chest. From the bottom, press up by straightening your arms, focusing on bringing your torso back up using your chest muscles. Keep your core tight and avoid shrugging your shoulders upward during the motion. 
  Common Errors: Going excessively deep (beyond comfort) which can stress the shoulder joint – depth is individual; stop when you feel a good stretch but no sharp pain. Not leaning forward at all (an upright torso shifts load to triceps, which is fine for triceps focus but less chest engagement). Also, letting the elbows flare too wide or track too far back can cause shoulder discomfort; maintain a moderate angle. Many people also drop too quickly – control the descent to protect shoulders. If bodyweight is too heavy, use an assisted dip machine or bands; if too easy, add weight with a dip belt.`,

        name: "Push-Up",
        description: `A classic bodyweight exercise targeting the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Push-ups are essentially a moving plank combined with a horizontal press, making them great for core stability and upper body strength. They primarily work the pectorals (similar motion to bench press) and can be modified in countless ways (e.g., incline, decline, weighted) to adjust difficulty and target slightly different areas. While unweighted push-ups might become easy for well-trained individuals, adding weight or doing advanced variations provides progressive overload. 
  Coaching Tips: Assume a plank position with hands on the ground slightly wider than shoulder-width, fingers pointing forward. Your body should form a straight line from head to heels. Engage your core and glutes to keep hips from sagging or piking. Keeping your head neutral (looking slightly ahead), bend at the elbows to lower your body toward the ground. Aim to touch your chest (or just lightly brush) to the floor, or get your elbows to about 90 degrees or a bit more. Keep your elbows at roughly a 45° angle from your body (not flared straight out). Push back up by extending your arms, fully locking out at the top and squeezing your chest. Maintain that straight-body alignment throughout. 
  Common Errors: Letting the hips sag or drop (losing core tension, which can strain the lower back) or lifting the hips too high (turning it into more of a downward dog yoga position) – maintain a rigid plank. Flaring elbows out to the sides (T-shape) which can strain shoulders; instead, use a slight tuck. Half-repping (not going low enough or not fully extending at top) reduces the effectiveness – use full range unless there’s a specific reason not to. Also, craning the neck towards the floor in an attempt to get “lower” (the chest should lead, not the chin). If standard push-ups are too hard, drop knees to ground as a regression or do incline push-ups on a bench; if too easy, elevate feet or add weight on your back (e.g., a weight plate or weighted vest).`,

        name: "Cable Crossover (Cable Fly)",
        description: `An isolation exercise for the chest, performed using a cable machine to mimic a fly motion (bringing arms together in front of the body). Cable crossovers keep constant tension on the pectoral muscles through the range of motion and allow a deep stretch and strong contraction (even crossing arms slightly for peak contraction). This exercise primarily targets the sternal head of the pectoralis major, and by adjusting the height of the pulleys (high-to-low, low-to-high), you can emphasize different portions of the chest (upper vs lower fibers). 
  Coaching Tips: Position two pulleys at a high setting above your head for a standard cable crossover (high-to-low). Stand centered between the cable stacks, take a handle in each hand. Stagger your stance (one foot forward) for stability and lean forward slightly from the waist. Start with arms opened wide in a “T” position or slightly back, feeling a stretch in your chest (but don't overstretch to pain). Your elbows should be slightly bent (maintain this slight bend throughout). In a controlled motion, bring the handles downward and forward in an arc, as if you’re hugging a big tree, until your hands meet or cross in front of your lower chest. Squeeze your chest at the point of fullest contraction. Allow the arms to return to the starting stretched position under control, keeping that slight elbow bend. If targeting upper chest (low-to-high crossover), set pulleys low and bring handles up and together above chest level in front of you. 
  Common Errors: Turning it into a pressing movement by bending and extending the elbows – elbows should stay at roughly the same angle; motion comes from the shoulders bringing arms together. Swinging the weight or leaning excessively and using body momentum, which reduces chest isolation. Not getting a full stretch or not crossing/meeting the hands (stopping short) – you want both a good stretch and contraction, though don't overstretch to where shoulders hurt. Also, ensure symmetrical movement; sometimes one arm can dominate, so concentrate on moving both arms evenly. Control the return phase; don't let the weight yank your arms back open abruptly.`,

        name: "Machine Chest Press",
        description: `A seated machine exercise mimicking the motion of a bench press, targeting the chest, front delts, and triceps. Machine chest presses (like Hammer Strength or selectorized machines) allow for a guided path of motion and can be safer for lifting heavy without a spotter, as well as friendly for beginners learning to press. They often isolate the chest effectively because stabilization demands are lower than free weights, meaning you can push the muscle to fatigue with less concern about form breakdown. 
  Coaching Tips: Adjust the seat so that the handles are approximately level with your mid-chest. Sit with your back firmly against the pad and feet flat on the floor. Grasp the handles with a full grip (palms down or neutral, depending on machine design). Keep your chest up and shoulder blades pulled together. Press the handles forward and extend your arms, contracting your chest, until your arms are straight (but don't forcefully lock out your elbows). Control the weight as you let the handles come back towards you, bending your elbows and stretching the chest. Go back until you feel a mild stretch or until the weight stack almost touches (depending on machine's range). Maintain a smooth motion and avoid shrugging your shoulders. Exhale on the press, inhale on the return. 
  Common Errors: Setting the seat too low or high (if too low, you press at an incline angle; too high and it's like a decline – generally aim for horizontal press path). Allowing your shoulder blades to protract fully (round forward) at the end of the press – maintain upper back tightness to keep tension on pecs and protect shoulders. Bouncing the weight stack or slamming the machine at the end of range – maintain control, especially as machines can give a false sense of security. Also avoid half-repping unless intended; use the full range available for maximum benefit. Since balance is not an issue here, ensure you're focusing on the mind-muscle connection with the chest and not just mindlessly pushing weight.`,

        name: "Pec Deck Fly",
        description: `A machine fly exercise for isolating the chest muscles, especially the pectoralis major. The pec deck machine guides your arms through a fly motion (often with forearms on pads or hands holding handles), providing constant tension and a fixed path that isolates the chest with minimal triceps or shoulder involvement. It’s great for pumping the chest and focusing on the chest contraction without stabilizer limitations. Typically, it targets the sternal (middle) fibers of the pecs, but slight seat height adjustment can shift emphasis. 
  Coaching Tips: Adjust the seat so that your shoulders align with the machine’s rotation axis, and set the arms of the machine to an appropriate starting position (the wider, the more stretch – set a stretch you can handle). If it’s the forearm pad style, place your forearms on the pads with elbows roughly 90°; if handles, grab them with a slight bend in your elbows. Sit with your back firmly against the pad and feet planted. Begin with arms open wide, feeling a stretch in your chest. From this position, use your pectoral muscles to bring the arms of the machine together in front of you in an arc. Keep a slight bend in the elbows throughout. Bring the pads or handles together at the center, squeezing your chest at the fully contracted position (you can imagine trying to touch your elbows together). Then slowly allow the weight to pull your arms back out to the starting stretch. 
  Common Errors: Setting the seat or handles incorrectly such that the movement strains your shoulders (excessive stretch or misalignment) – ensure a comfortable range and alignment. Another error is bouncing at the end of the range; avoid letting the weights slam or using momentum in the transition. Don't grip too hard with your hands (if using handles); sometimes that can activate arms too much – focus on the elbows/forearms doing the movement as an extension of your pecs contracting. Also, avoid hunching your shoulders; keep them down and back. And maintain a slight bend in the elbows; locking them out can transfer tension away from the chest and into the joints. Breathe out as you bring arms together, and in as you return.`,

        description: `A barbell press on a decline bench (angled downward about 15-30°), targeting the lower portion of the pectoral muscles (sternal head) more strongly, along with the triceps. The decline angle can often allow lifters to press slightly more weight than flat bench (due to reduced range of motion and leg drive angle), and some find it easier on the shoulders. It’s useful for emphasizing the lower chest fibers and can add variety to pressing routines for complete chest development. 
  Coaching Tips: Secure your legs in the decline bench supports to anchor yourself (your feet will be near the bench's end, often with padding holding your shins or ankles). Lie down and make sure your head is lower than your torso (bench angle set properly). Position yourself so that the bar is above your lower chest. Use a grip similar to your flat bench grip (slightly wider than shoulder width). Unrack the bar carefully (have a spotter if possible, because decline can be a bit awkward) and stabilize it over your chest. Lower the bar to touch around the lower chest or sternum area, keeping elbows somewhere around 45° from body (they may naturally tuck a bit more on decline). Press the bar back up to arms' length, focusing on contracting your chest and extending your elbows. Keep your shoulder blades retracted and down on the bench throughout. 
  Common Errors: Not securing the legs – you need them locked in to prevent sliding. Flaring elbows too wide or letting them drop too low (tucked excessively) – maintain a comfortable angle. It's possible to overarch the back but in decline it's somewhat fixed by position; still, keep core engaged. Another error is bringing the bar too high on the chest (toward upper chest/neck) which is biomechanically unfavored on decline and can strain shoulders; always aim for lower chest. As with any bench, avoid bouncing the bar off your body. Control the movement and use a spotter especially when going heavy; re-racking on decline requires precision due to angle, so ensure you're lined up with hooks when finishing.`,

        name: "Overhead Barbell Press (Military Press)",
        description: `The fundamental shoulder press exercise, performed standing (or seated) with a barbell, targeting the anterior and lateral deltoids (front and side shoulders), triceps, upper chest, and upper back stabilizers. Often called the military press when done with strict form, it is a key movement for building shoulder strength and size. EMG data suggests the overhead press induces high activation across all heads of the deltoid, surpassing many isolation moves:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}. It also requires core engagement for stabilization, especially when performed standing. 
  Coaching Tips: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart (or slightly narrower), and hold a barbell at about upper chest/collarbone level with hands just outside shoulder width, palms forward. Your elbows should be slightly in front of the bar (not flared directly out to the sides). Keep your core braced, glutes tight, and head neutral. Press the bar upward in a straight line if possible: move your head slightly back to allow the bar to pass, then once it clears your forehead, push your head forward again so the bar ends up directly over or slightly behind your head at lockout (arms fully extended). Lock out with straight wrists and elbows, and shrug your shoulders up a bit at the top (active shoulder position). Lower the bar under control back to the starting position at the chest/clavicle area. If done seated, use a seat with back support and maintain a similar form without using leg drive. 
  Common Errors: Excessive arching of the lower back (turning it into an incline bench press) – prevent this by squeezing your glutes, bracing abs, and not pushing your hips forward. Letting elbows flare out too much to the sides can strain the shoulder; keep them slightly forward. Not moving the head and bar in sync – you need to tilt the head back then forward to allow a straight bar path; don’t push the bar out in front of you in an arc around the face. Bringing the bar down too low onto the chest or bouncing it – usually lower to chin or just below chin level is sufficient, unless flexibility allows clavicle touch without strain. Also avoid half reps (pressing only partway up); use full range for strength unless doing partials intentionally. Keep forearms vertical under the bar throughout the press for optimal force transfer.`,

        name: "Push Press",
        description: `An overhead press variation where you utilize a small dip and drive from the legs to help propel the barbell upward, allowing you to press more weight and train explosive power. The push press still heavily works the shoulders and triceps, but the initial leg drive engages the quads and glutes and allows the deltoids to handle a heavier load in the top half of the movement. It’s a staple in Olympic weightlifting training and athletic training for transferring lower-body power into an upper-body movement. 
  Coaching Tips: Set up as you would for a standard overhead barbell press: bar on the front of shoulders, hands just outside shoulder width, chest up. Begin the movement with a quick dip: bend your knees and hips slightly (about a quarter squat) while keeping your torso upright (think of it like a rapid knee bend, not a full squat). Immediately drive up explosively with your legs, transferring force to the bar – as your legs extend, continue into pressing the bar overhead. The momentum from the leg drive should help the barbell break through the initial sticking point. Lock out the arms overhead as in a normal press, then control the bar back down to the shoulders. Reset and re-dip for the next rep. Remember to keep your core tight to handle the leg power translating into the bar and to avoid excessive back arch. 
  Common Errors: Turning it into a shallow jerk by dipping too low or re-bending the knees to catch (that's more of a power jerk). The dip should be quick and not too deep – a common mistake is a slow or overly deep dip which loses the elastic rebound. Another error is pressing too early before the leg drive contributes – make sure to time the press right after the explosive leg extension. Letting the torso tip forward during the dip will send the bar forward; keep torso vertical. Also, do not neglect the controlled eccentric; avoid just dropping the bar down – it should still be guided down to your shoulders. Because it's easy to add more weight on push press, ensure you can decelerate the load safely on the way down, or use bumpers and drop if necessary for safety on heavy sets (in appropriate settings).`,

        description: `An overhead press performed with dumbbells, which allows for a more natural range of motion and independent arm movement. It primarily targets the anterior and lateral deltoids, with secondary involvement of the triceps and upper traps. Using dumbbells can recruit stabilizer muscles more than a machine, and you can press with palms facing forward or a neutral grip (palms facing each other) to reduce shoulder strain if needed. This exercise can be done seated (for more stability and focus on shoulders) or standing (for more core engagement). 
  Coaching Tips: Sit on a bench with back support (or stand with feet shoulder-width). Start with a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder level: elbows bent about 90°, dumbbells just above your shoulders. If palms face forward, your elbows will be out to the sides; if neutral grip, elbows in front — choose what feels best on your shoulders. Keep your chest up and core braced. Press the dumbbells upward until your arms are extended overhead but not forcefully locked. As you press, you can allow the dumbbells to move slightly towards each other (a natural arc) but they don’t need to touch. Lower the weights back down slowly to the starting position at shoulder height. On the descent, your elbows should come down roughly to shoulder level (upper arms about parallel to floor) or slightly below if mobility allows comfortably. 
  Common Errors: Excessive arching of the back especially if seated (this might mean the weight is too heavy or you're fatiguing – keep your lower back against the pad and engage your core). Flaring elbows too far back if using a palms-forward grip – this could stress the rotator cuff; ensure you aren't letting elbows drift behind your body line at the bottom. Banging the dumbbells together at the top – this can make you lose balance; keep control. Not using full range of motion (half-repping) – ideally get a good stretch at bottom and full extension at top. Also, avoid letting wrists cock back; keep them neutral to support the weight aligned over your forearms. Use a spotter or be prepared to safely drop/ditch the dumbbells if you get stuck, especially in standing position to avoid injury.`,

This can be useful for focusing on pushing heavier loads safely or for high-rep work without worrying about balance. Machine presses can also be easier on those with shoulder mobility issues by guiding the movement. 
  Coaching Tips: Adjust the seat height so that the handles are roughly at shoulder height or just below when you’re seated. Sit with your back firmly against the pad. Grasp the handles (usually pronated grip, palms forward). Start with elbows bent and slightly out to the sides (around 45-60° from your body) – the machine’s design will often place you correctly. Press upward to extend your arms, pushing the handles overhead until your arms are near lockout (a slight bend is okay to keep tension). Control the weight back down until the handles return to near shoulder level. Keep your core engaged and do not let your lower back arch off the pad. Use the machine’s handles or seat belt (if provided) to brace if needed. 
  Common Errors: Setting the seat too low or high – if too low, you start the press too high (limited range); if too high, you might not get a full stretch or you could impinge shoulders. Adjust so you feel a good range. Lifting the butt off the seat or arching the back hard – maintain contact with the back pad to isolate the shoulders. Allowing your head to jut forward excessively (keep it neutral against or just in front of the pad). Using momentum: even though the machine stabilizes, swinging or bouncing at the bottom is possible if you drop fast and rebound – instead, pause slightly and then press. Lastly, partial reps can be useful for burnout, but ensure you do full range for the majority of your sets to benefit fully, unless intentionally doing otherwise.`,

This exercise targets all heads of the deltoid, particularly the anterior delts through a longer range of motion, and incorporates some additional rotator cuff engagement due to the rotation. It can help improve shoulder mobility and muscle engagement through a fuller range than a standard press. 
  Coaching Tips: Sit on a bench with back support (or stand if preferred, with core tight). Hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder level with palms facing your shoulders (as if at the top of a bicep curl) and elbows bent in front of you. Begin the movement by simultaneously pressing up and rotating the dumbbells: your elbows move out to the sides and palms turn to face forward as you press overhead. At the top of the movement, your arms are extended and palms face forward (like a normal press). Then reverse the motion: lower the weights while rotating your palms back towards you, ending in the starting position with palms facing your shoulders. This rotation should be controlled and continuous through the press. 
  Common Errors: Using too heavy a weight – the added rotation makes this harder than a normal press, and going too heavy can strain the shoulder or reduce the range of motion. Dropping the elbows too low or too far forward on the descent – keep them roughly at shoulder height at the bottom and in front of the body (not flared way out or tucked completely in). Losing coordination between the press and rotation – practice the fluid motion; it should feel like a smooth “open up” during the press and “close in” during the lower. As with any shoulder press, avoid overarching your lower back; keep your spine supported. Also, ensure a full rotation; some people basically just do a standard press with a small twist – instead, start fully internally rotated (palms in) and end fully externally rotated (palms out) to maximize benefits.`,

Dumbbell lateral raises involve lifting the arms out to the sides against gravity, and they also engage the anterior and posterior deltoids to a lesser degree, as well as the upper trapezius and serratus anterior for stabilization. This exercise is more about strict form and moderate weight; swinging heavy weights often shifts the work off the delts. It's a staple in hypertrophy routines for shoulders. 
  Coaching Tips: Stand (or sit) holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides, palms facing inward (neutral grip). Keep a slight bend in your elbows and maintain that bend throughout the movement. Leading with your elbows (imagine pouring water out of a pitcher as a cue, so your thumbs tilt slightly downward at top), raise your arms out to the sides until they reach about shoulder height (parallel to the floor). Your wrists, elbows, and shoulders should rise together in the same plane. Pause briefly at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to your sides under control. Keep your core engaged and torso upright; a very slight forward lean is okay, but avoid leaning back. 
  Common Errors: Using momentum by swinging the torso or jumping – this takes tension off the delts. If you find yourself doing that, reduce the weight. Raising the dumbbells too high (beyond shoulder level) – at the top, arms roughly parallel to floor is sufficient; higher can shift tension or impinge shoulders. Shrugging the shoulders excessively during the raise (this brings traps into play too much); instead, think of shoulders staying down and only the arms moving out. Another mistake is bending the elbows too much (turning it almost into a high curl) which can make it easier but less effective on the intended muscle – a slight bend is all that’s needed. Also, don't let the weights drop quickly; control the eccentric to get more out of it and protect your shoulder joints.`,

        name: "Rear Delt Fly (Bent-Over Lateral Raise)",
        description: `An isolation exercise focusing on the posterior deltoids (rear shoulders), as well as hitting the upper back (rhomboids, traps) to some extent. Performed bent-over with dumbbells (or on a reverse fly machine), this movement helps improve shoulder balance and posture by strengthening the often-neglected rear delts, which counteract the front delts and chest. It's important for shoulder health and a well-rounded physique. Typically done with lighter weights to ensure isolation of the small rear delt muscles. 
  Coaching Tips: Hold a dumbbell in each hand and hinge at the hips until your torso is near parallel to the floor (you can also sit on a bench and lean forward). Keep your back flat and a slight bend in your knees. Let your arms hang down with palms facing each other (neutral grip) and a slight bend in your elbows. Initiate the movement by squeezing your shoulder blades together and raising your arms out to the side and back, as if trying to pin your shoulder blades together. Focus on leading with your elbows and feeling the rear shoulder muscles contract. Raise until your arms are roughly in line with your body (or just below shoulder level, forming a “T” with your torso). Then slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position under control. Keep your neck neutral (gaze at the floor) and avoid using momentum. 
  Common Errors: Using too much momentum or turning it into a rowing motion (bending elbows significantly and pulling with lats/traps). The elbows should stay slightly bent but fixed in angle, and movement should occur at the shoulder joint, not the elbow. A common mistake is rising up out of the bent position during the lift – maintain your torso angle so the rear delts stay targeted. Also, some people let their head drop too much or hunch their back; keep spine straight and core tight. Going too heavy often results in limited range or swinging; it's better to use moderate weight and really isolate the rear delts. Avoid shrugging your shoulders up; let the back of the shoulders do the work instead of upper traps dominating.`,

        name: "Face Pull",
        description: `A rope cable exercise that targets the rear deltoids, external rotators (infraspinatus, teres minor), and mid/lower traps, making it excellent for shoulder health and posture. Face pulls involve pulling a rope towards your face, with a high elbow position and external rotation at the end, which strengthens the muscles that counteract internally rotated, hunched shoulder positions. It's commonly recommended by physiotherapists and strength coaches to improve scapular stability and prevent shoulder injuries, especially if you've done a lot of pressing. 
  Coaching Tips: Set a cable pulley to roughly face height and attach a rope handle. Grasp the rope with an overhand grip (palms facing down, thumbs toward you). Step back so there's tension on the cable with your arms extended in front at eye level. Stand with one foot forward for stability, core tight. Begin the movement by pulling the rope towards your face. As you pull, lead with your elbows high (flaring out to the sides) and draw your hands apart, aiming to bring the rope towards your nose or chin. At the end position, your upper arms should be roughly parallel to the floor and your hands near either side of your face. You should feel your shoulder blades squeezed together and your rear shoulders engaged. Control the rope back to the start position, allowing your arms to straighten and shoulder blades to protract forward. Keep the motion slow and focus on the muscle contraction rather than using momentum. 
  Common Errors: Letting the elbows drop too low – which turns it into more of a row (targeting mid-back more than rear delts). Make sure to keep the elbows at shoulder height throughout. Another mistake is not separating the hands/rope ends enough; you want to externally rotate at the end so that your knuckles point backward and you get that extra rotator cuff engagement. Using too much weight and leaning back or jerking will defeat the purpose (it should be a controlled, therapeutic-like movement). Also avoid shrugging up; keep shoulders down and back as you pull. Ensure the cable height is correct; if it's too low or too high it changes the line of pull – around upper chest to face height is ideal.`,

        name: "Power Snatch",
        description: `An Olympic weightlifting movement where a barbell is lifted explosively from the floor to overhead in one motion, with the catch occurring in a partial squat (power position) rather than a full deep squat. The snatch develops full-body power, speed, and mobility, particularly working the posterior chain (hamstrings, glutes), shoulders, traps, and back, as well as core stability. It is a highly technical lift that requires coordination and timing. Including the power snatch or its variations can improve athletic explosiveness and overhead strength/stability. 
  Coaching Tips: Stand with feet hip-width apart with a wide grip on the barbell (snatch grip such that the bar sits in the crease of your hip when standing). Start in a lowered position similar to a deadlift: hips down, back flat, chest up, and bar close to shins. Initiate the lift by extending your legs, then hips, keeping the bar close. Once the bar passes the knees, violently extend (jump) upwards, shrugging your shoulders and pulling yourself under the bar. Unlike the clean, your hands are wide so the bar doesn’t travel as high; you pull yourself under into a partial squat with arms extended overhead. Catch the bar overhead with elbows locked and knees bent (about a quarter to half squat), stabilizing the weight overhead (the bar should be slightly behind your head, over your shoulders/midfoot). Stand up fully with the bar overhead to complete the lift. Key cues: keep the bar path close (a slight sweep back), reach full extension (triple extension of hips, knees, ankles) before pulling under, and lock out the arms quickly to receive the bar overhead. 
  Common Errors: Not extending fully (rushing the pull under, resulting in less power imparted to the bar). Swinging the bar forward instead of pulling it close (this often happens if you don't keep the bar close or if you don't get your knees out of the way). Bending the arms too early (arm pulling instead of driving with legs/hips) can slow the bar and throw off timing. Also, failing to lock out the arms at the catch (pressing out the snatch) indicates either lack of timing or weight too heavy. Like the power clean, the power snatch is technical – starting with light weights and possibly learning from a coach or using progressions (like hang snatches, high pulls) is advised. Mobility is crucial: tight shoulders or hips can impede proper form. Ensure you have adequate overhead stability before going heavy.`,

This is an advanced calisthenics movement demonstrating significant upper body strength and balance. It heavily stresses the shoulder muscles similar to an overhead press, and requires good balance (if freestanding) or can be done with wall support for stability. 
  Coaching Tips: **Wall-Assisted Version:** Kick up into a handstand against a wall (back facing the wall or face facing the wall, depending on preference; back-to-wall is more common for reps). Place your hands shoulder-width apart on the ground, fingers splayed for balance. Your body should be relatively straight (hollow body position, engage core and glutes). From the handstand position, bend your elbows to lower your body. Aim to touch the top of your head lightly to the ground between your hands (you can use a pad for cushioning). Keep your elbows roughly at a 45-60° angle from your body (not flared straight out). Once you reach the bottom (head touches or almost touches), press through your hands and extend your arms to drive your body back up to a full handstand. Keep looking slightly forward (not directly down) to maintain balance and an open shoulder angle. **Freestanding Version:** Same mechanics, but you must also balance without wall support, which is significantly harder. 
  Common Errors: Flaring elbows out to the side too much (which can strain shoulders and reduce power) – try to keep elbows from flaring excessively. Allowing your lower back to arch and ribs to flare – maintain a tight core (hollow body) to protect your spine and improve force transfer. Not using full range of motion (common if strength is lacking; doing partial head nod push-ups) – while partials can build strength, full range ensures balanced development (using a padded target for the head can help consistency). If using wall, avoid overly leaning into it or kicking off it; it’s there for balance, but you should still press mostly vertically. Another mistake is letting the head crash to the floor; control the descent to gently touch. For beginners, one can work negative reps (slowly lowering) or pike push-ups (feet on a box, body piked) to build up to this challenging move.`,

        name: "Barbell Bicep Curl",
        description: `The classic barbell curl is a staple for building the biceps brachii muscle and overall arm size. It allows both arms to work together to move a heavier load than they might with dumbbells. EMG data indicates that barbell curls elicit very high activation of the biceps:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}, making it one of the most effective biceps exercises. The movement also engages the brachialis and brachioradialis as secondary elbow flexors. Strict form is important to maximize biceps engagement and minimize swinging. 
  Coaching Tips: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell with an underhand grip (palms up) about shoulder-width grip. Start with arms fully extended and bar resting against your thighs. Keep your elbows pinned to your sides (they should not travel forward much during the curl). Curl the bar up toward your chest by contracting your biceps, exhaling as you lift. Focus on keeping your torso upright and not using momentum; only your forearms should move. Bring the bar up until the elbows are fully bent (roughly at shoulder level), then squeeze the biceps at the top. Slowly lower the bar back down to the start, fully straightening your arms at the bottom to stretch the biceps. Keep wrists straight (don't let them bend back) and shoulders relaxed (don’t shrug). 
  Common Errors: Using momentum or "cheating" by swinging the body or leaning back to get the bar up – this takes tension off the biceps. If you find you have to swing, reduce the weight to maintain strict form. Another error is letting the elbows drift forward (turning it into more of a front raise); keep them at your sides to isolate the biceps. Not controlling the eccentric (lowering phase) is also common – resist the weight on the way down for better results. Partial reps where you don't fully extend at the bottom leave out the stretch portion of the movement; unless you're doing intentional partials, go through full range. Also avoid flaring your elbows outward; they should stay pointing down, not out.`,

        name: "Dumbbell Bicep Curl",
        description: `A fundamental arm exercise using dumbbells to work the biceps one arm at a time (or together). Dumbbell curls allow a natural rotation of the forearm (supination), which can enhance biceps contraction since one function of the biceps is forearm supination. They also help address any strength imbalances between arms. You can perform them simultaneously, alternating, or even with different grip angles (like hammer or supinating curls). The standard alternating supinating dumbbell curl effectively isolates the biceps and builds peak and strength. 
  Coaching Tips: Stand (or sit) with a dumbbell in each hand, arms at your sides, palms facing your thighs (neutral grip to start). For alternating curls, start with one arm: curl the weight upward, and as you lift, rotate your forearm so your palm faces up by the time it’s halfway up (this is the supination). Keep your elbow near your side and don’t let it drift forward. Curl until your hand is roughly at shoulder level and your palm is facing your shoulder. Squeeze the bicep at the top. Then lower the dumbbell back down, rotating it back to neutral as you do so, until the arm is fully extended. Repeat with the other arm. You can also do both arms at the same time (in which case, maintain symmetry and balance). Keep your torso upright and avoid swinging. 
  Common Errors: Swinging the dumbbells or using body English – this often happens if the weight is too heavy or as you fatigue; drop weight or reset form to keep it strict. Not rotating the wrist (if doing a supinating curl) – some people keep it palms-up all the way; while that still works biceps, using the rotation engages the biceps’ supination function fully. Allowing elbows to move forward (especially at the top) which gives your biceps a rest and involves the shoulder – keep them at your sides. Also, half-repping is common; ensure you extend fully for a good stretch at the bottom and come up to a full contraction. If seated, avoid rocking backward; keep back against the bench if using one for support.`,

        description: `A bicep curl variation where the dumbbells are held with a neutral grip (palms facing each other), targeting the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles in addition to the biceps brachii. Hammer curls are great for building overall arm thickness and strength in the forearm and the upper arm since the brachialis (under the biceps) can contribute significantly. They also tend to be shoulder-friendly and can often be done with slightly heavier weights than supinated curls due to mechanical leverage. 
  Coaching Tips: Stand holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides with palms facing your thighs (neutral grip). Keep your elbows tucked to your sides. Curl the dumbbells up while keeping your palms facing each other throughout (as if hammering a nail, hence the name). The movement comes from bending at the elbow – raise the weights until your thumbs or the end of the dumbbells approach the shoulders. You should feel your biceps and forearms working. Lower the weights back down to the starting position under control, fully extending your arms. You can do this alternating one arm at a time or both simultaneously. Maintain an upright posture and avoid swinging your body. 
  Common Errors: Using excessive momentum (swaying back or swinging the weights). Because hammer curls often allow heavier loads, there's a tendency to cheat – instead, choose a weight you can control. Letting the elbows drift forward is another error; keep them at your sides to isolate the elbow flexors. Not using full range (stopping too short at bottom or not coming up enough) – ensure a complete curl and extension to engage brachialis fully. Also, avoid internally rotating or externally rotating the shoulder; the motion should be like driving your fist straight up. Keep wrists neutral (don’t bend them); the wrist should stay in line with the forearm, just like a hammer strike.`,

        description: `A biceps isolation exercise performed on a preacher bench (pad), which prevents the upper arms from moving and allows a strict curl movement. This targets the biceps, particularly emphasizing the lower portion and the stretch when the arm is extended. It also heavily involves the brachialis. Because your arms are stabilized on the pad, momentum is reduced and the biceps do more direct work. Preacher curls can be done with an EZ-bar, straight bar, or dumbbell (one-arm at a time). They are excellent for building the biceps peak and improving mind-muscle connection due to the strict form. 
  Coaching Tips: Adjust the preacher bench so your armpits comfortably rest at the top of the pad and your upper arms lay flat on the angled surface. Grip an EZ-bar or barbell with an underhand grip, hands about shoulder-width apart (EZ-bar is easier on wrists). Start with your arms extended over the pad but not fully locked (keep a slight bend to avoid joint strain at bottom) – you should feel a stretch in the biceps. From this bottom position, curl the weight up by contracting your biceps, keeping your upper arms against the pad. Raise the bar until your forearms are roughly vertical and biceps fully contracted (don't go so high that tension drops, usually stopping a bit before vertical is ideal). Squeeze at the top, then slowly lower the weight back down to the starting position, controlling the negative. Avoid coming fully off the pad or lifting your elbows; keep them planted. 
  Common Errors: Using momentum or bouncing at the bottom – since the pad stops your arms, some might bounce the bar off the bottom which can strain the biceps tendon; instead, pause slightly at the bottom before curling. Lifting the elbows off the pad, especially at the top – this reduces isolation and can become more of a shoulder movement; keep arms glued to the pad. Overextending the elbows at the bottom (which can cause discomfort or injury); maintain a slight flexion in the elbow at the very bottom to keep tension on biceps and protect the joint. Another mistake is gripping too narrow or wide in a way that causes wrist discomfort; adjust grip to where wrists feel neutral (often EZ-bar helps). And as always, avoid half-repping unless intentional; use the pad to achieve a full stretch and contraction for maximum benefit.`,

This variation emphasizes the long head of the biceps by starting from a more elongated state, which can help develop the biceps peak and increase the range of motion. Many find they feel a strong stretch and contraction using incline curls, but the weight used will be less than a standard curl due to the disadvantageous starting position. 
  Coaching Tips: Set an incline bench around 45 degrees (you can adjust angle slightly to preference). Sit back against the bench with a dumbbell in each hand, letting your arms hang straight down towards the floor, palms facing forward (supinated) or facing inward (neutral) to start – you can rotate as you curl. Keep your shoulders pulled back against the bench (don't let them hunch forward). From this stretched position, curl both dumbbells upward while keeping your upper arms roughly perpendicular to the floor (they will naturally angle back a bit due to incline, which is fine). You can perform them simultaneously or alternate arms. Turn your palms to face your shoulders if you started neutral (i.e., supinate) as you lift. Curl to full contraction (dumbbells near shoulder level), then squeeze the biceps. Slowly lower the weights back down, really feeling the stretch at the bottom as your arms straighten. Keep your elbows pointing down toward the floor – don't let them drift forward which reduces the stretch. 
  Common Errors: Allowing the shoulders to roll forward at the bottom – this loses the biceps stretch and can stress the shoulder joint; keep shoulder blades retracted. Using momentum (swinging arms or lifting off the bench); maintain back and head on the bench and let the biceps do the work. Bringing the elbows forward as you curl up – this turns it into a regular curl and shortens the range; instead, keep elbows back. Not fully extending at bottom; the benefit of incline curls is the stretch, so ensure you go down to where you feel it (but without hyperextending the elbow). Also, watch wrist alignment; don't let them flop back due to the stretch tension, keep them in line with forearm to avoid strain. Start with lighter weight to get used to the deep stretch, as it can cause significant soreness if you're not accustomed.`,

        description: `A highly focused dumbbell curl performed one arm at a time, usually with the arm braced against the inside of the thigh. It intensely isolates the biceps, minimizing any shoulder involvement and momentum, thus "concentrating" the work on the biceps muscle. This exercise often creates a strong peak contraction and can help improve the mind-muscle connection with the biceps. It typically targets the brachialis and the biceps peak (long head) due to the arm position. 
  Coaching Tips: Sit on a bench with your legs spread enough to allow your arm to hang in the middle. Hold a dumbbell in one hand. Lean forward and brace the back of your upper arm against the inside of your same-side thigh, just above the elbow. Let the dumbbell hang down near your calf with arm almost fully extended (but don’t lock out completely). Your palm faces up. Keeping your torso still, curl the dumbbell upward toward your shoulder. Only your forearm moves; your upper arm stays anchored on your leg. Curl all the way up, squeezing the biceps hard at the top. Then lower the dumbbell slowly to the starting position, fully controlling the negative. Allow nearly full extension to get a stretch at the bottom without resting the dumbbell on the floor (unless you’re finishing the set). Avoid any jerking—move in a slow, controlled fashion. Repeat for reps then switch arm. 
  Common Errors: Swinging the dumbbell or using body English—concentration curls should be strict. Avoid bouncing at the bottom or heaving the weight up with your shoulder. Sometimes lifters will move their leg to assist; keep that thigh stationary as a support. Don’t allow the elbow to slide off the thigh or move; it should be fixed in place to isolate the curl. Also, not going through full range (stopping too high or not extending enough) can reduce effectiveness—aim for a full contraction and stretch. Choose an appropriate weight to maintain good form; it's an isolation move, so lighter with perfect technique trumps heavy with poor form here.`,

        description: `A biceps curl performed with a cable machine, usually using a straight bar or EZ-bar attachment on a low pulley. The cable provides constant tension throughout the range of motion, which can enhance the pump and muscle fiber recruitment. Cable curls target the biceps similarly to free-weight curls, but the continuous tension can make the movement feel more challenging at the extremes of the range. It's great for variety and achieving a peak contraction without momentum. 
  Coaching Tips: Attach a straight bar or EZ-curl bar to a low pulley. Stand facing the machine and grab the bar with an underhand grip, hands about shoulder-width apart. Step back a foot or so if needed to ensure tension even when arms are extended. Start with arms fully extended down towards the pulley, elbows at your sides. Keeping your elbows pinned, curl the bar up toward your chest/shoulders by contracting your biceps. Avoid leaning back; keep posture upright or with a very slight forward lean. Squeeze the biceps hard when you reach the top (elbows flexed fully). Then slowly extend your arms, resisting the pull of the cable on the way down until your arms are straight again. Maintain constant control; the cable will try to pull you faster especially at the end of range, so fight that. Keep wrists in line (don't let them bend back). 
  Common Errors: Letting the elbows drift forward – ensure they stay at your sides so you're not turning it into a drag curl type movement (unless intentional). Using your back to lean and help curl – step close enough and engage core to minimize torso movement. Not controlling the eccentric: cables provide continuous tension, so capitalize on that by lowering slowly; don't just let the weight yank your arms down. Another mistake is standing too far from the station, which can cause you to lean or can create an awkward angle; stand where you feel steady tension throughout but can keep balance. Also be mindful of the setup – if the pulley is too high off the ground, it might not give tension at bottom; ideally use a pulley at ground level or nearly so.`,

Reverse curls are great for developing forearm size and strength and can help improve the appearance of the upper forearm and elbow area, contributing to overall arm thickness. They also strengthen grip to some extent. Typically done with an EZ-bar (preferred for wrist comfort) or straight bar, and with relatively lighter weights than standard curls due to the mechanical disadvantage. 
  Coaching Tips: Stand holding a barbell or EZ-curl bar with an overhand grip (palms facing the thighs) at about shoulder width. Your thumbs will be wrapped around the bar pointing toward each other. Start with arms extended down, bar against your thighs. Keeping your elbows by your sides, curl the bar upward toward your chest. Since your palms are pronated, focus on keeping your wrists straight (they will want to bend down; resist that). Curl until your forearms are about vertical or you reach a comfortable flex (the range is a bit shorter for many due to forearm tension). You should feel the top of your forearms and outer arms working. Lower the bar back down slowly to the start position, fully extending the arms and feeling a stretch in the forearms. Maintain an upright posture and don't swing. 
  Common Errors: Letting the wrists sag (flex) – keep them neutral; if they bend, you're reducing the effectiveness on brachioradialis and could strain your wrists. Using too much weight and ending up rocking or turning it into a partial high pull – use a weight that allows strict form. Elbows drifting away from the sides can happen if weight is too heavy; keep them tucked. Also, some might not go through any real range and just do small pulses; try to get a decent range (though you might not touch the bar as high as a supinated curl, that's okay). Using an EZ-bar with the angled grip can reduce strain on the wrists compared to a perfectly straight bar, so consider that if you feel discomfort.

Chin-ups heavily engage the biceps brachii, in addition to the back (latissimus dorsi) and other pulling muscles. In fact, chin-ups are often considered as much an arm exercise as a back exercise because the underhand grip allows the biceps to contribute significantly. Weighted chin-ups can be used to progressively overload once bodyweight is mastered. They are excellent for building arm and back strength together and are functional for overall upper-body pulling power. 
  Coaching Tips: Grasp a pull-up bar with a supinated (underhand) grip, hands about shoulder-width apart (a little narrower than your pull-up grip). Start from a dead hang with arms fully extended. Engage your core and pull your shoulder blades down and back to initiate the pull. Focus on bending at the elbows and pulling your body upward until your chin clears the bar (aim to touch your chest to the bar). Keep your elbows in front of you (they'll naturally stay relatively close due to the grip). Pause briefly at the top if possible, then lower yourself down in a controlled manner until arms are straight. Avoid swinging or kipping unless that's intended; this is usually done strict to target the biceps and lats. If you're not strong enough yet for a chin-up, use an assisted machine or resistance bands for help, or perform slow negatives (jump up, then lower slowly). 
  Common Errors: Flaring elbows out excessively – in a chin-up, elbows should stay roughly pointing forward, not out to sides like a wide-grip pull-up. Using momentum (kicking legs or jerking) takes away from the muscle-building aspect; unless training for reps or CrossFit-style, keep it strict for strength/hypertrophy. Not going all the way down (many do half-rep chin-ups); ensure full elbow extension at bottom for a full range rep, which also stretches the lats and biceps fully. Also, reaching with the chin by craning the neck instead of actually pulling higher is a cheat – keep neck neutral and focus on pulling your collar bone to the bar. If doing multiple reps, avoid completely relaxing at the bottom which can unsettle your shoulder; maintain engaged shoulders even at full hang (active hang). As you fatigue, you might start to swing; reset your body between reps or cross your feet behind you to stabilize if that becomes an issue.`,

Named after strongman George Zottman, this curl works the biceps brachii intensely during the lifting portion and then the brachialis and brachioradialis during the lowering portion, making it a well-rounded arm developer. It is typically done with dumbbells, and requires a weight light enough to control the reverse eccentric portion. Zottman curls can help build both the front of the arm and the forearms effectively. 
  Coaching Tips: Stand with a dumbbell in each hand, arms at your sides, palms facing forward (supinated). Perform a standard dumbbell curl: curl the weights up towards your shoulders, keeping elbows at your sides. As you reach the top of the curl and the dumbbells are near shoulder level, rotate your hands to a palms-down (pronated) position. Now, with this overhand grip, slowly lower the dumbbells back down to your sides (this is essentially a reverse curl on the way down). Focus on controlling the descent, as this is where the brachioradialis works hard. Once your arms are extended at the bottom, rotate your grip back to palms forward (starting position) for the next rep. Keep the movement smooth and controlled throughout, and avoid swinging. 
  Common Errors: Using too heavy a weight – the limiting part is usually the lowering (reverse curl) phase, so if you go too heavy, you'll end up dropping fast or not being able to control the eccentric. Elbows moving away from the sides is another error; keep them fairly anchored to isolate the arms. Incomplete rotations – some might not fully pronate at the top or supinate at the bottom; try to get the full turn of the wrists to engage all target muscles properly. Also, watch for wrist posture: in the pronated lowering phase, resist the urge to let wrists flop downward; keep them neutral/straight to really hit the forearms. It's a complex movement, so execute it a bit slower than a normal curl to maintain coordination and tension.`,

  Coaching Tips: Lie on a flat bench as you would for a normal bench press. Take a grip on the bar that is closer than shoulder width – typically hands at about shoulder-width apart or slightly inside (around 12 inches apart between your thumbs) is effective; avoid going too narrow such that wrists feel uncomfortable. Unrack the bar, keeping your elbows tucked closer to your sides than in a regular bench (approximately 30° from your torso). Lower the bar under control to your lower chest or upper abdomen (around the solar plexus area). Your elbows should stay under or just outside the bar, not flared out wide. Press the bar back up by extending through the elbows, driving through your triceps. Maintain tight shoulder blade retraction and keep your whole body tight (legs, core) for stability. Avoid flaring the elbows out during the push; keep them relatively tucked to maintain triceps focus. 
  Common Errors: Using an excessively narrow grip (e.g., index fingers touching each other) which can strain wrists and doesn't significantly increase triceps activation beyond a moderately close grip – stick to roughly shoulder-width grip. Letting elbows flare way out like a regular bench press – this shifts stress back to chest and shoulders; instead keep them tucked. Touching the bar too high on the chest (like near clavicles) – with close grip, aim a bit lower on the torso to keep elbows in a good path. Bouncing the bar off the ribcage – control the rep to protect wrists and ribs. Also be mindful of wrist position; keep them straight (neutral) rather than letting them cock back under the weight, as the narrow grip can add pressure to wrists. Use a spotter or safety racks, as with any heavy bench press variant.`,

        name: "Lying Triceps Extension (Skull Crusher)",
        description: `A classic isolation exercise for the triceps where you lie on a bench and lower a bar (EZ-bar commonly) towards your forehead or behind your head, then extend your arms. Often nicknamed "skull crushers" (when lowering to the forehead), this move targets the long head and lateral head of the triceps intensely. It provides a good stretch on the triceps when done through a full range of motion (especially if lowering behind the head) and is a proven builder of triceps size and strength. It's important to perform with control to avoid hitting your head or straining your elbows. 
  Coaching Tips: Lie flat on a bench, holding an EZ-curl bar or dumbbells with arms extended straight up over your chest. Use an overhand grip on the bar, hands about shoulder-width apart (EZ-bar is easier on wrists). Keeping your upper arms fairly stationary (elbows pointing up), bend your elbows to lower the weight. If doing to the forehead (hence skull crusher), lower until the bar is a couple of inches above your forehead. Alternatively, you can drop the bar just behind your head which increases the stretch (your elbows will drift back slightly). Throughout the descent, keep your elbows around shoulder width apart (don’t let them flare too wide). From the bottom position, contract your triceps to straighten your arms and push the weight back up to the starting position, finishing with elbows near-locked. Keep your upper arms steady; the motion is at the elbow joint. 
  Common Errors: Letting the elbows flare out to the sides – this can reduce triceps isolation and put more stress on elbow joints; keep them fairly in line (some flaring is natural, but not excessive). Using too much weight and ending up moving your shoulders (e.g., dropping the upper arms back and forth, turning it into a quasi pullover motion). Hitting the forehead due to lack of control – always move the bar under control; if needed, lower behind head to be safe. Not getting a full range of motion; ideally, you want a good elbow bend (around 90 degrees or more) to really work the triceps, unless limited by discomfort. Also, be mindful of elbow pain – some people find lowering behind the head with an EZ-bar or using dumbbells (which allow wrist rotation) to be easier on the elbows than straight-bar to forehead. As with any lying exercise, ensure secure grip to avoid dropping the bar.`,

        name: "Cable Triceps Pushdown",
        description: `A staple isolation exercise for the triceps using a cable machine. It primarily hits the lateral and medial heads of the triceps by extending the arms against the cable's resistance. Pushdowns allow for constant tension and are joint-friendly due to the fluid cable motion. They can be done with various attachments (straight bar, V-bar, rope, etc.), each slightly changing the feel, but the basic movement remains extending the elbows to push the weight down. This exercise is excellent for high reps and getting a pump in the triceps, and helps strengthen lockout and stability for pressing movements. 
  Coaching Tips: Attach a straight bar or rope to a high pulley. Stand facing the machine, feet shoulder width, and grasp the bar/rope with an overhand grip (for rope, neutral grip). Start with elbows bent about 90° or a bit more, elbows pinned to your sides. Your upper arms should remain stationary next to your torso. Using your triceps, press the attachment downward by extending your elbows. Push down until your arms are fully straight and your elbows are locked out (or nearly locked). Squeeze the triceps at the bottom for a moment. Then, resist the weight as you let your forearms rise back up, stopping when your elbows reach around 90-120° (forearms roughly horizontal) – don't let the weight pull you so far that your elbows leave your sides or your shoulder rotates. Throughout, keep your chest up and shoulders down (don't hunch). If using a rope, you can spread the ends apart at the bottom to increase the contraction. 
  Common Errors: Flaring the elbows out or moving the upper arms – if elbows drift away from your body, other muscles like shoulders can get involved; keep them tucked in. Using too much body English, such as leaning over excessively or using your back to push down – a slight forward lean is fine, but your torso should be stable. Not fully extending at the bottom (stopping short) – you want the full lockout to engage the triceps completely, unless avoiding lockout for joint reasons. Also, avoid letting the weight stack slam by controlling the upward phase; keep tension throughout. Some people let their wrists break (bending them) but it's generally better to keep wrists neutral and focus the movement at the elbow. Lastly, don't shrug your shoulders; keep them depressed to isolate the triceps.`,

        name: "Overhead Triceps Extension (Dumbbell)",
        description: `A triceps exercise focusing on the long head by placing the arms overhead, typically done with a single dumbbell held with both hands or with one dumbbell in each hand. This movement provides a great stretch on the triceps and effectively isolates elbow extension. Performing it seated or standing and keeping the elbows up by the ears is key. The dumbbell overhead extension helps improve the stability and strength of the triceps through a long range of motion. It's important to use good form to avoid elbow flaring or undue stress on the shoulder. 
  Coaching Tips: Grasp a dumbbell securely with both hands (hold it by the inner plate/handle, forming a triangle with your hands around the handle). Press it overhead until your arms are extended. Tuck your chin slightly and keep your core tight. From this position, lower the dumbbell behind your head by bending at the elbows. Keep your upper arms as still as possible, close to your ears (elbows pointing upward). Lower until you feel a good stretch in the triceps (the dumbbell can go down to about neck level or even slightly below head if mobility allows), ensuring you maintain control and don't flare the elbows wide. Press through your triceps to raise the dumbbell back up, extending your arms fully overhead. You can also do this one arm at a time with a single dumbbell or seated to minimize back sway. 
  Common Errors: Elbows flaring out too much to the sides – try to keep them pointing up; a slight natural flare is okay but if they go wide, the long head is less engaged and shoulder stress increases. Using momentum or arching the back – keep your core engaged and ribs down to avoid excessive arch; if standing, you might stagger your feet for stability. Dropping the dumbbell too quickly or not controlling the lower phase (which can be dangerous and less effective) – always control especially when the weight is behind your head. Partial reps that don't fully stretch or extend – try to use as full a range as comfortable for best results. Additionally, using a weight that's too heavy may strain your elbows or shoulders; this exercise is often better with moderate weight and higher reps to focus on the muscle stretch and contraction.`,

        name: "Dip (Triceps Emphasis)",
        description: `Parallel bar dips performed with a more upright torso and elbows tucked back, to focus on the triceps. Unlike the chest-emphasis dip which involves leaning forward, the triceps dip keeps your body more vertical, which reduces chest involvement and increases the load on the triceps. This compound exercise is excellent for building triceps strength and mass and also engages the anterior deltoids and pecs secondarily. Weighted dips can greatly challenge the triceps once bodyweight is not enough. Proper form is crucial to avoid shoulder strain. 
  Coaching Tips: Grasp parallel bars and support your body with arms straight (the top of a dip). For triceps focus, keep your torso as upright as possible and your legs straight down or slightly forward. Tuck your elbows in close to your sides as you bend them to lower into the dip. Lower yourself until your upper arms are roughly parallel to the ground (elbows about 90 degrees) or a bit more if flexibility and shoulder comfort allow. Throughout the descent, keep your elbows from flaring outward; they should track backwards roughly. You should feel a strong load on the back of your arms. Press back up by extending your elbows, focusing on pushing through your palms and squeezing your triceps to straighten the arms back to the top. Avoid swinging or kipping; maintain a controlled motion. If bodyweight is easy, add a dip belt with weight. If it's hard, use band or assisted dip machine. 
  Common Errors: Flaring elbows out wide (which turns it more into chest dip and can strain shoulders) – keep them relatively tucked. Leaning forward too much, which again engages chest; an upright posture keeps emphasis on triceps. Not going deep enough – a very shallow dip won't hit the triceps through much range; aim for about parallel upper arms at least, as long as shoulders are okay. However, also beware going excessively deep if you lack shoulder mobility; don't force a range that causes pain in the shoulder joint. Using momentum or swinging legs to bounce out of the bottom – do it strict to really stress the triceps. Lastly, avoid letting your head jut forward or shoulders shrug – keep shoulder blades slightly retracted and neck neutral.`,

        name: "Diamond Push-Up",
        description: `A bodyweight push-up variation with hands close together (forming a "diamond" or triangle shape with thumbs and index fingers touching) to target the triceps more heavily. Diamond push-ups are significantly harder than regular push-ups due to the increased triceps involvement and longer range of motion. They also work the inner chest and front shoulders, but the narrow hand position makes the triceps do a lot of the pressing work. This exercise is convenient and effective for triceps development without equipment. 
  Coaching Tips: Get into a push-up position on the floor. Place your hands close together under your chest, with your index fingers and thumbs touching (forming a diamond/triangle shape). Keep your body straight from head to heels (maintain a plank). Start with arms extended. Lower yourself by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your sides (they will naturally flare a bit outward but try to avoid them flaring too wide). Aim to bring your chest towards your hands; your sternum or a point just below it should be the target to touch the "diamond". Keep your core tight and avoid sagging or piking your hips. Once you reach the bottom (chest near hands), press back up by straightening your arms, focusing on squeezing the triceps. Lock out the elbows at the top and then repeat. If a full diamond push-up is too challenging, do it from the knees or elevate your hands on a bench to reduce the load initially. 
  Common Errors: Letting the elbows flare out significantly – while some outward angle is fine, if elbows go straight out it stresses shoulders; aim to keep them around 45° relative to body or closer. Not keeping the body rigid, i.e., hips sagging (puts pressure on lower back) or hips piked up (takes load off the arms) – maintain a straight line by engaging abs and glutes. Incomplete range of motion: doing only half-reps (though if you’re building strength, partials can be a stepping stone, but work towards full range). Hand placement too far forward can make it weirdly harder on shoulders; ensure hands are under chest, not under face. Also, some may experience wrist strain due to the angle; a possible fix is doing them on push-up handles or fists to keep wrists neutral. Diamond push-ups are tough, so break form only indicates you might need to regress to an easier variant and work up.`,

        name: "Floor Press",
        description: `A bench press variation done by pressing a barbell or dumbbells while lying on the floor. It is a partial range of motion exercise that eliminates the lower portion of the bench press, focusing on the lockout phase and thus the triceps. Floor presses are popular in powerlifting training to build triceps strength and address sticking points in the press, and they also reduce shoulder strain because the elbows stop on the floor, limiting how far they can go down. They still work the chest and front delts, but with a much greater emphasis on triceps to finish the press from the dead-stop off the floor. 
  Coaching Tips: Lie on the floor under a rack with a barbell (as if setting up for a bench press on the floor). Bend your knees with feet flat on floor (for stability) or keep legs straight if preferred (less arch). Take a typical bench press grip on the bar (usually around shoulder-width or a bit wider). Unrack the bar and position it above your lower chest. Lower the bar down under control until the backs of your upper arms (triceps) lightly touch the floor. Pause briefly as your elbows rest on the ground – this removes momentum (a true floor press often uses this pause). Your forearms should be vertical in this bottom position (adjust grip if not). Press the bar back up by extending through the elbows and driving your upper back into the floor, finishing at full arm extension. That counts as one rep. If using dumbbells, you can have a partner hand them to you or hoist them up and lie back. Keep shoulder blades retracted and down, similar to bench form. 
  Common Errors: Bouncing arms off the floor – the floor press should be more controlled, using the floor as a hard stop, but not as a trampoline. Not pausing: while you can do touch-and-go reps, one of the benefits is building starting strength via a pause; avoid rapid fire if focusing on triceps power. Elbows flared too high (towards shoulders) – even on floor, you want roughly 45° angle to protect shoulders. If using a bar, a very narrow grip might target triceps more but can strain wrists; moderate grip is usually best. Another potential issue: some people try to arch excessively or drive legs; leg drive is limited on floor, so rely on upper body. Ensure safe setup: use a power rack or spotters because you're limited in range and can't drop elbows below body; having safety pins at correct height can be wise. If doing alone, dumbbells might be safer as they can be dropped to sides.`,

        name: "Triceps Kickback",
        description: `An isolation exercise for the triceps where you "kick" a dumbbell back by extending your arm behind you, typically performed bent over or kneeling on a bench. Kickbacks target the triceps (especially the lateral head) at the top of the arm extension range, emphasizing contraction over heavy loading. They can provide a great pump, but must be done with strict form and relatively light weight, as it's easy to cheat and the lever arm is long. While some consider them less effective compared to presses or extensions (because it’s hard to use heavy weight), they are still useful as a finishing move for triceps definition and endurance. 
  Coaching Tips: Hold a dumbbell in one hand. Assume a staggered stance or kneel on a bench with the opposite knee/hand for support, so that you're bent over at about a  torso parallel to the ground (similar to one-arm row position). Start with your upper arm parallel to your torso (elbow bent ~90 degrees, tucked near ribs, forearm hanging down). Keeping your upper arm stationary, extend your elbow to straighten your arm, kicking the dumbbell back until your arm is fully extended and parallel to the torso. Squeeze your triceps at the top (your hand should end up near your hip level, arm straight). Then bend your elbow to return to the start position with control (forearm hanging about vertical). Only the forearm moves; your shoulder and upper arm should not swing. Keep your core tight to avoid twisting. Use a weight that allows you to execute with control—it's usually lighter than for other triceps moves. 
  Common Errors: Swinging the entire arm or using body momentum — often seen if weight is too heavy; reduce weight and isolate the elbow movement. Not extending fully (stopping short of straight arm) — you want that full contraction unless it causes elbow pain. Dropping the elbow (upper arm) during the negative – maintain the upper arm parallel to ground; if it drops, you lose tension. Also watch that you don’t flare the elbow out; keep it close to your body. Many people also tend to rush kickbacks; use a deliberate tempo and squeeze at the top. Lifting the upper arm beyond torso line at the end (overextending shoulder) isn't necessary and can cause shoulder rotation; just go until arm is straight. Because gravity has less resistance at bottom of rep, ensure you really engage through the whole movement (peak tension is when arm is straight).`,

        name: "Triceps Dip Machine",
        description: `A weight machine that simulates the dip motion, specifically targeting the triceps in a supported, controlled manner. This could be a seated dip machine where you push down on handles beside the seat, or an assisted dip machine where your knees rest on a platform for help, but here we refer to the dedicated seated triceps dip press. It closely mimics parallel bar dips but with a fixed path, making it easier to isolate the triceps and use progressive weight without stabilizer fatigue. It primarily works the triceps, with secondary involvement of the chest and shoulders. According to EMG research, dip movements (machine or bodyweight) are top-tier for triceps activation:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}. 
  Coaching Tips: Adjust the seat height so that the handles are around chest level or slightly below your armpits when seated. Sit down and grasp the handles firmly. If there is a belt, secure it. Position your elbows at your sides (they will point back behind you in the starting position). Initiate the movement by pressing the handles downwards, straightening your arms. Exhale as you push and focus on contracting your triceps to extend your elbows fully at the bottom of the movement (arms straight). Pause briefly at full extension. Then allow the weight to rise as your arms bend, returning to the starting position with elbows roughly 90 degrees (or until the weight stack almost touches if using selectorized). Keep your torso upright against the backrest (if provided) and avoid hunching your shoulders. Perform the motion smoothly and avoid locking out harshly to protect your elbows. 
  Common Errors: Setting the seat too low or too high (which can make the range awkward and stress shoulders) – ensure a comfortable alignment where elbows can go straight back. Partial reps where you don't fully extend – unless saving elbows, try to complete the range to get full triceps engagement. Letting the shoulders shrug up or roll forward – keep them down and back, let the triceps do the work. If using an assisted dip machine (kneeling on platform), a common error is bouncing on the platform instead of using muscle force – maintain control. Also, don't allow your upper body to drift; keep back on pad if one is there, or core engaged if not, to prevent leaning that changes the angle. Using too much weight such that you need to jolt or start by bouncing is counterproductive; choose a weight that you can press with only arm power, even if challenging on the last reps.`,

        name: "Reverse Grip Triceps Pushdown",
        description: `A variation of the cable triceps pushdown performed with an underhand (supinated) grip on the bar. This grip can put emphasis on the medial head of the triceps and some lifters find it more comfortable on the wrists. The mechanics are similar to the standard pushdown, but the grip change can slightly alter muscle fiber recruitment. It is typically done with lighter weight than the standard grip because the underhand position is biomechanically a bit weaker. It's a good variation to include for complete triceps development and to hit the triceps from a different angle. 
  Coaching Tips: Set up a cable machine with a straight bar at head height. Grasp the bar with a supinated grip (palms facing up) about shoulder-width or a bit narrower. Keep your elbows at your sides, forearms roughly horizontal to start. Stand upright or with a slight forward lean, and ensure there's tension in the cable. Press the bar down by extending your elbows, just like a normal pushdown, but maintain that underhand grip. Push down until your arms are straight and your hands are near your thighs, feeling your triceps contract. Because of the supinated grip, your elbows may want to drift forward slightly; fight to keep them pinned to your sides. Slowly let the bar rise back up until your forearms are back to about parallel with the floor (or a comfortable flex). Repeat, keeping the motion strict. You may feel more activation towards the inside of your triceps. 
  Common Errors: Flaring elbows outward or moving them a lot – keep them tucked in to isolate triceps. Turning it into a kind of rowing motion by pulling shoulders back – avoid that; only the elbows should hinge. Using too heavy weight which can strain wrists in this position; if you feel wrist discomfort, lighten the load or switch to an EZ-bar or even do one arm at a time with a handle which allows your wrists to rotate freely. Also avoid cutting the range of motion short – get a full extension and a decent bend (without letting elbows move). Some might arch or lean way over to muscle it down; stay relatively upright and use muscle, not bodyweight. The setup should be such that the cable is roughly in line with your forearms at the start; if it's too high or low you might not get ideal tension, so adjust as needed.`,
